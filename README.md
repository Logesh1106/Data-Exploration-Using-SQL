# Data-Exploration-Using-SQL

This project focuses on exploring COVID-19 data using SQL. The data used in this project was obtained from reliable sources such as the World Health Organization and various national health agencies. 

The project involves importing the data into a SQL database and using SQL queries to explore and analyze the data. 

The queries are used to calculate and visualize key metrics such as the total number of cases, deaths, and recoveries, as well as the distribution of cases across different countries and regions.
